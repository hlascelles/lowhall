      The Duddon Valley is one of the least known parts of the Lake District: a traditional
      farming valley of green fields, dry stone walls and grazing sheep.
      There are few outsiders, but an abundance of natural
      features: high fells, rocky crags, waterfalls, the meandering
      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Duddon">Duddon</a>
      , even a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardknott_Roman_Fort">Roman
      fort</a>.
    </p>

    <p align="left">Low Hall offers a wide range of activities from the doorstep:
      strolls along the Duddon and up to the pub in
      Seathwaite, low fell walking along pack horse trails, or high fell
      walking up nearby Caw Fell (nearly 2000 ft) and the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_of_Coniston">Old Man of
        Coniston</a>
      (2600 ft).
      The house is within an hour's drive of the big Lakeland peaks: Scafell,
      Helvellyn, Langdale Pikes etc.
    </p>
    <p>The Duddon Valley also offers rock climbing, swimming, canoeing (graded 3 with
      some easy 4), fishing and bird-watching.
