        Low Hall is an old stone-built farmhouse in the
        <a target="_blank"
           href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnerdale">Duddon
          Valley</a>,
        one of the finest and
        most secluded parts of the Lake District. The house stands in farmland with impressive
        views of the fells in all directions.

        Low Hall has been owned by only one family since it was restored in the 1960s, and is
        treated very much as a family home. The style is old-fashioned comfort with polished wood
        and deep armchairs, though with all modern amenities.
