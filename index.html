      Low Hall is an old stone-built farmhouse in the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnerdale">Duddon Valley</a>,
      one of the finest and
      most secluded parts of the Lake District. The house stands in farmland with impressive
      views of the fells in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hall has been owned by only one family since it was restored in the 1960s, and is
      treated very much as a family home. The style is old-fashioned comfort with polished wood
      and deep armchairs, though with all modern amenities.
    </p>

      The house can accommodate up to ten people and is available year-round on personal
      recommendation for a consideration which covers the running costs.
